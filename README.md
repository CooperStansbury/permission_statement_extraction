# permission_statement_extraction
This is a Jupyter Notebook in Python3 for extracting possible statements of permission from informed consent documents. The goal is to generate a training set that will generalize beyond the current dataset for extracting terms related to 'permitting' in the consent context. This work is loosely organized and changing rapidly.
