443,example this informed consent form is for social service providers in the community x and who we are inviting to participate in research y titled the community response to malaria project

689,if a non geisinger researcher wants information that identifies you then a member of the mycode team will contact you to see if you want to learn more about the study the researcher is doing
689,these researchers may work for geisinger universities or medical schools or other research facilities government agencies like the national institutes of health nih public agencies foundations or other groups that conduct or sponsor research or companies that do medical research like drug companies researchers must get permission to use your samples and information from two geisinger committees the geisinger institutional review board and the mycode governing board
689,geisinger will make every effort to protect your phi but we cannot absolutely guarantee that your information will be safe
689,there is a chance that researchers might find information that could be important to your health and the health of your family members when they study your mycode samples
689,many people are needed to provide samples to do this research
689,mycode activities such as collecting storing or testing samples may be paid for by the following sources geisinger s own funds government grants grants from non profit agencies that support research and or commercial partners such as drug companies study 2006 0258 version number 28 date 10 16 15 page 1 of 6 irb number 2006 0258 irb approved 10 19 2015 what will happen when i participate in mycode when you agree to participate in mycode you give us permission to collect samples of your saliva or blood not more than 2 tablespoons at a time and store them in a biobank which is a safe secure place for storing the samples use your samples for research studies that we approve this might include studies that analyze your dna your genes use information from your geisinger medical record for research studies that we approve this information might include diseases you have medicines you take and results of medical tests you get contact you in the future to get more information or tell you about other research studies tell you about results we get from studying your samples that might help you how will you collect my mycode samples there are several ways we might collect your samples a phlebotomist will collect a blood sample when you are having blood drawn because your doctor ordered tests you can volunteer to provide mycode blood samples when you aren t already having blood drawn for test your doctor has ordered you might be asked to provide a saliva spit sample using a kit we will provide will geisinger share my samples and my information your samples and the information that we get from studying your samples or your medical record may be shared with other researchers
689,then the researcher will contact you to tell you more about their study
689,we will only inform you when we find information that we believe can be helpful in your medical care
689,if we tell you that you have a higher chance of having a health problem because of something we discover from studying your sample then there is a risk that you might be surprised or upset
689,for example if we find that you have an increased chance of getting breast cancer then your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often than most women

689,you will not own any information medical tests medicines or other products that are created from research that used samples and information from mycode
689,by studying the dna of many different people and comparing it to information in their health records we hope to find differences in dna that help people stay healthy or in some cases get sick
689,a member of the geisinger mycode team may contact me to ask if i want to participate in future mycode approved studies and to collect additional information
689,you and your family members will get information that tells you what we found in your sample get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information the initial information and support geisinger gives you will be free of charge

538,anna m refai d m d informed constent for dental whitening description of the procedure in office tooth whitening is a procedure designed to lighten the color of my teeth using a combination of a hydrogen peroxide gel and a specially designed ultraviolet lamp may be used
538,i understand that if my teeth have these conditions i should have my cavities filled or my fillings redone before undergoing the whitening treatment
538,the inflammation is usually temporary which will subside in a few days but may persist longer and may result in significant pain or discomfort depending on the degree to which the soft tissues were exposed to the gel or ultraviolet light
538,even if these areas are not currently sensitive they can allow the whitening gel to penetrate the teeth causing sensitivity
538,this is due to inadvertent exposure of a small area of those tissues to the whitening gel or the ultraviolet light
538,people with existing sensitivity recession exposed dentin exposed root surfaces recently cracked teeth abfractions microcracks open cavities leaking fillings or other dental conditions that cause sensitivity or allow penetration of the gel into the tooth may find that those conditions increase or prolong tooth sensitivity or pain after whitening treatment
538,i understand that the zoom lamp emits ultraviolet radiation uva and that patients taking any drugs that increase photosensitivity should consult with their physician before undergoing zoom treatment
538,since it is impossible to state every complication that may occur as a result of whitening treatment the list of complications in this form is incomplete
538,these treatments include whitening toothpastes gels other in office whitening treatments take home whitening kits risks of consent for treatment i also understand that whitening treatment results may vary or regress due to a variety of circumstances
538,during the entire treatment a plastic retractor will be placed in my mouth to help keep it open and the soft tissues of my mouth i e my lips gums cheeks and tongue will be covered to ensure they are not exposed to either the gel or light
538,e cervical abrasion erosion these are conditions which affect the roots of the teeth when the gums recede and they are characterized by grooves notches and or depressions that appear darker than the rest of the teeth where the teeth meet the gums
538,normally tooth sensitivity or pain following a whitening treatment subsides within 24 hours but in rare cases can persist for longer periods of time in susceptible individuals
538,if any open cavities or fillings that are leaking and allowing gel to penetrate the tooth are present significant pain could result
538,in signing this informed consent i am stating i have read this informed consent or it has been read to me and i fully understand it and the possible risks complications and benefits that can result from the whitening treatment and that i agree to undergo the treatment
538,vaseline may also be applied as needed and i will be provided an ultraviolet light filter for my eyes
538,alternative treatments i understand i may decide not to have the whitening treatment at all
538,i understand that almost all natural teeth can benefit from whitening treatments and significant whitening can be achieved in most cases
538,i understand that the results of the whitening treatment are not intended to be permanent and secondary repeat or take home treatments may be needed for me to maintain the tooth shade i desire for my teeth
538,after the treatment is completed the retractor and all gel and tissue coverings will be removed from my mouth

227,please take the enclosed blood draw package and instructions with you and give them to the staff at the lab
227,in that case being in this study is not likely to help you personally
227,for the same reason your sample that is stored for future research will be labeled with your name group health number and other identifying information
227,we also let you know then that we might contact you in the future to tell you about about other research projects to see if you were interested

227,this is necessary because we want to return the results to you and your doctor for use in your medical care and possibly include some results in your medical record
227,this means it won t include your name group health number or other information that is usually used to identify you
227,the report might contain positive results meaning that we found one or more genetic variants that could affect how you respond to certain medications
227,we will keep the link between your name and your research code number at group health and will not share it with other researchers unless you give us permission
227,the report will only include results that might be useful for your medical care

353,this consent addendum provides information in addition to the main consent for the research study in which you are participating
423,the oral medications include clomiphene citrate clomid and aromatase inhibitors letrozole and the inj ectable medications are the hmg s gonadotropins namely follistim gonal f and menopur
423,clomid and letrozole are typically taken from cycle day 3 through 7
423,these tablets are typically taken for ve days of each menstrual cycle
423,a twin pregnancy is often a welcome event however it is carries a greater risk of pregnancy complications than a singleton pregnancy
423,whenever you are seen for monitoring you will be asked to call the of ce in the afternoon between 2 30 3pm to get the results of the hormone levels and receive instructions for the continuation and eventual completion of your treatment cycle
423,although ohss is a serious medical condition it is important to remember that it occurs infrequently and it resolves completely over time
423,the second risk associated with hmg therapy it is exceedingly uncommon with clomid or letrozole is a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss which only occurs if the woman has ovulated and is more serious and protracted if she is pregnant
423,clomid and letrozole work by signaling the brain to trigger the release of luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh the two hormones that are responsible for the development and release of the egg from the ovary
423,i certify that i have read this document that i have been given the opportunity to ask questions and that they have all been answered fully and satisfactorily
423,hmg s are given by subcutaneous inj ection
423,oftentimes treatment with clomid or letrozole is combined with an injection of another hormone called hcg ovidrel to trigger ovulation
423,when the follicles are mature ovidrel is given to induce the release of the egg s from the ovary
423,when these hormones are given multiple follicles can be stimulated to grow
423,finally given the many insurance requirements for advance noti cation of any infertility services including the necessary medications our of ce will need the time to perform the precerti cation to maximize your insurance reimbursement
423,depending on your anticipated response you will be asked to return to the of ce after 3 6 days for monitoring
423,when triplets or greater are conceived the likelihood of premature delivery and other pregnancy complications is quite high
423,multiple gestation occurs in 5 of clomid induced pregnancies less than 5 of letrozole induced pregnancies and approximately 20 of pregnancies conceived with hmg therapy combined with either timed intercourse or iui s in ivf cycles the likelihood of multiple gestation is reduced by transferring only 1 or 2 embryos
423,ovulation induction consent your physician has advised that you consider treatment with medications that stimulate ovulation
423,after the ovidrel is given you will not need additional stimulation medications or sonograms
423,the goal of treatment with clomid and letrozole is to l stimulate ovulation in a woman who does not spontaneously cycle 2 produce predictable ovulation in women with irregular menstrual cycles and 3 gently stimulate women with prolonged infertility to produce one or two extra eggs per month
423,once you have decided to undergo treatment with medications that stimulate ovulation you will be given an appointment for an inj ection teaching session

689,if a non geisinger researcher wants information that identifies you then a member of the mycode team will contact you to see if you want to learn more about the study the researcher is doing
689,these researchers may work for geisinger universities or medical schools or other research facilities government agencies like the national institutes of health nih public agencies foundations or other groups that conduct or sponsor research or companies that do medical research like drug companies researchers must get permission to use your samples and information from two geisinger committees the geisinger institutional review board and the mycode governing board
689,geisinger will make every effort to protect your phi but we cannot absolutely guarantee that your information will be safe
689,there is a chance that researchers might find information that could be important to your health and the health of your family members when they study your mycode samples
689,many people are needed to provide samples to do this research
689,mycode activities such as collecting storing or testing samples may be paid for by the following sources geisinger s own funds government grants grants from non profit agencies that support research and or commercial partners such as drug companies study 2006 0258 version number 28 date 10 16 15 page 1 of 6 irb number 2006 0258 irb approved 10 19 2015 what will happen when i participate in mycode when you agree to participate in mycode you give us permission to collect samples of your saliva or blood not more than 2 tablespoons at a time and store them in a biobank which is a safe secure place for storing the samples use your samples for research studies that we approve this might include studies that analyze your dna your genes use information from your geisinger medical record for research studies that we approve this information might include diseases you have medicines you take and results of medical tests you get contact you in the future to get more information or tell you about other research studies tell you about results we get from studying your samples that might help you how will you collect my mycode samples there are several ways we might collect your samples a phlebotomist will collect a blood sample when you are having blood drawn because your doctor ordered tests you can volunteer to provide mycode blood samples when you aren t already having blood drawn for test your doctor has ordered you might be asked to provide a saliva spit sample using a kit we will provide will geisinger share my samples and my information your samples and the information that we get from studying your samples or your medical record may be shared with other researchers
689,then the researcher will contact you to tell you more about their study
689,we will only inform you when we find information that we believe can be helpful in your medical care
689,if we tell you that you have a higher chance of having a health problem because of something we discover from studying your sample then there is a risk that you might be surprised or upset
689,for example if we find that you have an increased chance of getting breast cancer then your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often than most women

689,you will not own any information medical tests medicines or other products that are created from research that used samples and information from mycode
689,by studying the dna of many different people and comparing it to information in their health records we hope to find differences in dna that help people stay healthy or in some cases get sick
689,a member of the geisinger mycode team may contact me to ask if i want to participate in future mycode approved studies and to collect additional information
689,you and your family members will get information that tells you what we found in your sample get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information the initial information and support geisinger gives you will be free of charge

538,anna m refai d m d informed constent for dental whitening description of the procedure in office tooth whitening is a procedure designed to lighten the color of my teeth using a combination of a hydrogen peroxide gel and a specially designed ultraviolet lamp may be used
538,i understand that if my teeth have these conditions i should have my cavities filled or my fillings redone before undergoing the whitening treatment
538,the inflammation is usually temporary which will subside in a few days but may persist longer and may result in significant pain or discomfort depending on the degree to which the soft tissues were exposed to the gel or ultraviolet light
538,even if these areas are not currently sensitive they can allow the whitening gel to penetrate the teeth causing sensitivity
538,this is due to inadvertent exposure of a small area of those tissues to the whitening gel or the ultraviolet light
538,people with existing sensitivity recession exposed dentin exposed root surfaces recently cracked teeth abfractions microcracks open cavities leaking fillings or other dental conditions that cause sensitivity or allow penetration of the gel into the tooth may find that those conditions increase or prolong tooth sensitivity or pain after whitening treatment
538,i understand that the zoom lamp emits ultraviolet radiation uva and that patients taking any drugs that increase photosensitivity should consult with their physician before undergoing zoom treatment
538,since it is impossible to state every complication that may occur as a result of whitening treatment the list of complications in this form is incomplete
538,these treatments include whitening toothpastes gels other in office whitening treatments take home whitening kits risks of consent for treatment i also understand that whitening treatment results may vary or regress due to a variety of circumstances
538,during the entire treatment a plastic retractor will be placed in my mouth to help keep it open and the soft tissues of my mouth i e my lips gums cheeks and tongue will be covered to ensure they are not exposed to either the gel or light
538,e cervical abrasion erosion these are conditions which affect the roots of the teeth when the gums recede and they are characterized by grooves notches and or depressions that appear darker than the rest of the teeth where the teeth meet the gums
538,normally tooth sensitivity or pain following a whitening treatment subsides within 24 hours but in rare cases can persist for longer periods of time in susceptible individuals
538,if any open cavities or fillings that are leaking and allowing gel to penetrate the tooth are present significant pain could result
538,in signing this informed consent i am stating i have read this informed consent or it has been read to me and i fully understand it and the possible risks complications and benefits that can result from the whitening treatment and that i agree to undergo the treatment
538,vaseline may also be applied as needed and i will be provided an ultraviolet light filter for my eyes
538,alternative treatments i understand i may decide not to have the whitening treatment at all
538,i understand that almost all natural teeth can benefit from whitening treatments and significant whitening can be achieved in most cases
538,i understand that the results of the whitening treatment are not intended to be permanent and secondary repeat or take home treatments may be needed for me to maintain the tooth shade i desire for my teeth
538,after the treatment is completed the retractor and all gel and tissue coverings will be removed from my mouth

353,this consent addendum provides information in addition to the main consent for the research study in which you are participating
423,the oral medications include clomiphene citrate clomid and aromatase inhibitors letrozole and the inj ectable medications are the hmg s gonadotropins namely follistim gonal f and menopur
423,clomid and letrozole are typically taken from cycle day 3 through 7
423,these tablets are typically taken for ve days of each menstrual cycle
423,a twin pregnancy is often a welcome event however it is carries a greater risk of pregnancy complications than a singleton pregnancy
423,whenever you are seen for monitoring you will be asked to call the of ce in the afternoon between 2 30 3pm to get the results of the hormone levels and receive instructions for the continuation and eventual completion of your treatment cycle
423,although ohss is a serious medical condition it is important to remember that it occurs infrequently and it resolves completely over time
423,the second risk associated with hmg therapy it is exceedingly uncommon with clomid or letrozole is a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss which only occurs if the woman has ovulated and is more serious and protracted if she is pregnant
423,clomid and letrozole work by signaling the brain to trigger the release of luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh the two hormones that are responsible for the development and release of the egg from the ovary
423,i certify that i have read this document that i have been given the opportunity to ask questions and that they have all been answered fully and satisfactorily
423,hmg s are given by subcutaneous inj ection
423,oftentimes treatment with clomid or letrozole is combined with an injection of another hormone called hcg ovidrel to trigger ovulation
423,when the follicles are mature ovidrel is given to induce the release of the egg s from the ovary
423,when these hormones are given multiple follicles can be stimulated to grow
423,finally given the many insurance requirements for advance noti cation of any infertility services including the necessary medications our of ce will need the time to perform the precerti cation to maximize your insurance reimbursement
423,depending on your anticipated response you will be asked to return to the of ce after 3 6 days for monitoring
423,when triplets or greater are conceived the likelihood of premature delivery and other pregnancy complications is quite high
423,multiple gestation occurs in 5 of clomid induced pregnancies less than 5 of letrozole induced pregnancies and approximately 20 of pregnancies conceived with hmg therapy combined with either timed intercourse or iui s in ivf cycles the likelihood of multiple gestation is reduced by transferring only 1 or 2 embryos
423,ovulation induction consent your physician has advised that you consider treatment with medications that stimulate ovulation
423,after the ovidrel is given you will not need additional stimulation medications or sonograms
423,the goal of treatment with clomid and letrozole is to l stimulate ovulation in a woman who does not spontaneously cycle 2 produce predictable ovulation in women with irregular menstrual cycles and 3 gently stimulate women with prolonged infertility to produce one or two extra eggs per month
423,once you have decided to undergo treatment with medications that stimulate ovulation you will be given an appointment for an inj ection teaching session

460,however silver amalgam continues to be endorsed by the ada as an acceptable filling material
460,silver amalgam has been used for decades as a filling material for teeth and there are no proven scientific studies accepted by the american dental association which supports the belief by some opponents to the material that there is a possibility although unproven that silver amalgam may have an effect on the general health of a person due to its mercury content

251,and therefore it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to determine in the future that the sample was taken from my child
251,in this event the usidnet repository could contact our doctor and potential y transmit back to us study results or a request for my child to participate 1 in additional studies although the repository would stil not have our identity in its records and would not have enough information to contact us without the assistance of my doctor
251,if my doctor is unavailable or is unable to contact us for some reason i understand that the repository wil not be able to contact us nor provide any information to us concerning my child s sample
251,the usidnet repository wil not have my child s name address or other specific identifying information to link the sample specifically to him her
251,the specimen will be given a unique code number for future identification and the record maintained by the repository wil only contain general information such as age sex state of residence diagnosis and molecular defect if known

251,i would would not like to be contacted by my doctor in the future about the results of research studies performed on my sample or with possible opportunities for me to join additional research studies
251,since the primary immunodeficiency pi diseases are rare donation of this sample to the repository may give a broader group of scientists access to rare research materials from patients and families affected with primary immunodeficiency
251,because the link to our name has been broken the usidnet repository will probably be unable to provide us with any information about scientific findings that may be discovered by scientists working with the sample specifically or whether any results that are published in the scientific literature are related to the sample that we submitted

653,the cdc guidelines simply state at the time of rupture of membranes intrapartum chemoprophylaxis should be given to all pregnant women identified as gbs carriers
653,a number of additional prospective studies comparing induction and expectant management followed guise duff 1992 natale milne campbell potts webster halinda 1994 shalev peleg eliyahu nahum 1995 grant serle mahmood sarmandal conway 1992 wagner chin peters drexler newman 1989 marshal 1993 alcalay hourvitz reichman luski quint barkai et al 1996 and chua arulkumaran sailesh selamat ratnam 1995
653,what are my risks maternal colonization of gbs adds another layer of complexity to the management of women with term prom and the reason the nurse midwives of believe midwifery services llc are strong advocates of screening prenatally
653,one important component of the management provided by the nurse midwives at believe midwifery services llc is the complete avoidance of vaginal exams after the rupture of membranes until birth is imminent or unless doing so would change the management plan
653,your midwife will also encourage you to read this informed consent again so you will be prepared with any questions in the event labor does not commence for twenty four hours
653,clients are also extended the right to revisit their management plan and choose induction of labor if they no longer desire expectant management
653,neither the acnm clinical bulletin nor the acog committee opinion on gbs prevention offer specific recommendations regarding management of term prom in gbs positive women beyond the recommendation that antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered
653,i am aware of the risks of prom and am responsible for and have freely chosen to take the following action q i have chosen expectant management and understand the importance of monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection notifying my midwife with any concerns
653,a registered nurse or midwife will provide an in person assessment each day either in the clinic or your home as part of the maternity package fee
653,consistent with the midwifery model of care your nursemidwife will discuss antibiotic options with each couple and assist in making the best decision for your family
653,preterm newborns are more likely to acquire infection and have greater morbidity when compared to term newborns therefore the true incidence of neonatal morbidity following 24 hours of prom in women at term is less than noted in these studies
653,in addition the majority of women who were gbs positive did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis therefore this study does not provide guidance
653,the cochrane collaboration subsequently published a review of the management options for women with term prom that concluded that the differences in outcomes between induction and expectant management are not substantial and women should be informed of risks and benefits of each option to make an informed choice dare middleton crowther flendady varatharaju 2006
653,updated may 2014 informed choice for prelabor rupture of membranes at term a positive gbs culture is often thought to indicate immediate induction in women who have term prom but this recommendation is not specified in the gbs guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc
653,the term prom study did not show any difference in the overall rate of neonatal infection between the induction or expectant management groups
653,finally it is important to remember that antibiotics effective for the treatment of anaerobic microorganisms were not available in the 1960s because of this both maternal and neonatal infection were associated with significant morbidity
653,the practice to consistently provide information about the options of expectant management verses immediate induction of labor to women with term prom and to involve them in the decision making process is congruent with midwifery hallmarks and philosophy of care
653,fetal well being screening during these visits is an additional fee per your homebirth agreement and any medications that might be required
653,there was no difference in rates of neonatal infection between groups however neonates from the expectant management group were more likely to be admitted to the nicu

689,they decide if the research is done in a way that limits the possible harm to the participants makes sure that the risks of participating are reasonable and protects your privacy the mycode governing board makes sure that research that uses your samples and information will be a good use of the samples and information in the mycode biobank and help us learn more about health and disease how will you protect my privacy in most cases researchers do not need information that could identify you when they are doing research using your mycode samples and data
689,you and your family members will get information that tells you what we found in your sample get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information the initial information and support geisinger gives you will be free of charge

730,however there are technical and scientific reasons why in rare cases the result determined by this test could be inaccurate
730,what are other potential risks genetic testing can reveal many things about you including the mutations that may cause a disease in you or members of your family
730,in some instances this may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the athena diagnostics and or others
730,what are the neurome neurological exome test limitations although neurome neurological exome tests can provide information that is useful to the diagnosis of medical conditions it is important to understand that this test is subject to certain limitations 1 the neurome neurological exome test may not identify the genetic basis of your or your family member s disorder even if one exists
730,4 post test counseling to provide information about appropriate specialist interventions associated with clinically relevant results
730,this gives those people and companies the right to prevent others from using those patented genes for certain purposes
730,this means that a genetic change variant was identified but it is unknown whether the variant is the cause of medical problems in you
730,if you are the patient the testing described above is being ordered by your physician to see if you have change s in genes or gene products as limited by the test s ordered
730,furthermore there may be proprietary data held by other companies which are not available to us for use in our analysis
730,if for example information is inaccurate or incomplete or samples are missing contaminated or mislabeled if samples from key family members are not available or if there is some other problem with the sample when it is provided to the testing lab the samples may not be usable for the neurome neurological exome test or the results of the test may not be accurate or reliable
730,any specimens that you have donated which are used in research may result in new products tests or discoveries
730,i have been given the opportunity to ask questions before i sign and i have been told that i can ask other questions at any time
730,certain people and companies have been granted patent rights on certain genes
730,please read this information and feel free to ask your physician questions before you agree to get tested
730,parental testing may be recommended to find out if a parent also carries the genetic variant or to determine the variant s clinical significance
730,the laboratory s analysis represents a good faith effort to use current scientific knowledge to identify and classify variant s that may have a role in a disease however current scientific knowledge about the function of variants genes and other portions of the genome is incomplete
730,if information is inaccurate or incomplete or the sample is contaminated or mislabeled or if there is some other problem with the sample when it is provided to the testing laboratory the sample may not be usable for the site specific genetic test or the results of the test may not be accurate or reliable
730,you may experience some discomfort at the site of needle entry and there is a risk of a black and blue mark

730,signature of individual being tested date printed name of individual being tested signature of parent or legally authorized representative date printed name of parent or legally authorized representative relationship to individual being tested glossary dna deoxyribonucleic acid the molecule that encodes genetic information
730,because of this in some cases the neurome neurological exome test will not be able to recognize the cause of a disease even though the tests may identify the presence of the variant in the dna
730,please note if you are a family member who has agreed to testing to assist in evaluation of the patient s genetics neither you nor your physician will necessarily receive the results of the test
730,these changes may be due to a loss deletion gain duplication or substitution of genetic material
730,also even if the neurome neurological exome test identifies an underlying genetic cause of the disorder in a family it is possible that it will not allow a prediction of the prognosis or severity of the disease lead to a change in disease management or provide a clinical benefit to patients
730,if the results of the molecular genetics tests are positive that means that an individual may be a carrier of a certain disease be predisposed to developing a certain disease or actually have the specific disease or condition that was ordered by your physician
730,the testing is being done because it may help determine whether patient is affected with or at risk to someday be affected with a specific genetic disorder subject to limitations discussed in this form
730,the method used for the targeted site specific genetic test which is called capillary sequencing has an analytical sensitivity of approximately 99 for the detection of small changes in genes variants and therefore provides a valid approach to test for specific variants previously identified through the neurome neurological exome test
730,general information regarding genetic testing you will receive what is involved a blood body fluid or tissue specimen will be collected from you
730,if the person getting the tests performed lacks the capacity to consent this consent form will need to be signed by a person authorized to consent for that person
730,the neurome neurological exome test read this section if you are receiving the neurome neurological exome test what is different about a neurome neurological exome test a neurome neurological exome test differs from many other types of genetic tests because instead of looking at only one or a few genes the test looks at approximately 20 000 genes in the human genome to arrive at a potential genetic cause and diagnosis
730,signature of person obtaining consent printed name of person obtaining consent date statement of the individual being tested i the undersigned have been informed about the test s purpose procedures possible benefits and risks and i have received a copy of this consent

730,your refusal to have your specimen used for research purposes will not affect your results
730,the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina generally protects you against discrimination based on your genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment
730,some words are starred when they are first used
730,it is important for you to understand that there is a possibility that the test results may not be able to determine whether you or a family member have a genetic disease or will develop one in the future
730,if you are the patient genetic testing is done because your physician believes it may help determine whether you are affected with or at risk to someday be affected with a specific genetic disorder a mutation or change in your genetic code
730,it is important to understand the limitations of testing and to discuss these limitations with your physician or genetic counselor before testing
730,their patient has been given the opportunity to ask questions about this consent and seek genetic counseling
730,the physician ordering the test will evaluate this information in relation to patient s medical condition or the medical condition of family member s

730,athena diagnostics requests your permission to use your specimen clinical information and data in a de identified way without any identifying information for research educational studies commercial purposes and or publication if appropriate
730,you may want to consider further independent testing consult with your physician or pursue genetic counseling even if the results are negative
730,the accuracy and reliability of results is affected by the quality of the sample and information provided
730,some of the information may be important to your present or future health some of it may have nothing to do with your health and for much of it we will not know how it might or might not affect your or your family s health
730,genetic testing may identify changes that place you at risk to develop a disease in the future or may reveal changes that have unknown significance
730,please understand that due to the complexity of genetic testing and the important implications of the test results these results will be reported only to the patient s ordering physician or designee and that you must contact your physician to obtain the results of the tests
730,therefore you would not share in any financial benefits from these products tests or discoveries
730,in these ways mutations may cause a disease or make someone more likely to develop a disease
730,or you have changes in gene products that can lead to a genetic disease
730,information regarding target site specific genetic testing read this if you are receiving the target site specific genetic test targeted site specific genetic test limitations although targeted site specific genetic tests can provide information that is useful to the diagnosis of medical conditions it is important to understand that this test is subject to certain limitations 1 the targeted site specific genetic test may not identify the genetic basis of your disorder even if one exists
730,these methods will allow the testing laboratory to determine an important piece of your genetic code
730,i voluntarily agree to genetic testing
730,if you are the patient s family member the testing is being done because it might be helpful in evaluating the genetics of the patient
730,the laboratory s analysis represents a good faith effort to use current scientific knowledge to identify a possible genetic cause of disease however current scientific knowledge about the function of variants genes and other portions of the genome and the ways in which genetic disorders are inherited is incomplete
730,also the chance of an incorrect result due to laboratory error incurred during any stage of the testing cannot be completely excluded
730,what if the results are uncertain you may learn that a variant of uncertain clinical significance was identified by a genetic test
730,what should happen before and after testing your physician or other lawfully authorized person such as a genetic counselor should provide you with the following 1
730,these test results can include gene variants not known to be specifically associated with a disease or gene variants known to be associated with a disease but not believed to be related to the condition that led to the testing secondary findings
730,if you change your mind and do want to use your specimen for research it will not be possible to reliably retrieve your specimen or data once they are de identified
730,also there are some portions of the genome that the neurome neurological exome test may not capture and sequence sufficiently in your sample s note the doctor ordering the test can request information about how well genes of interest were covered by the neurome neurological exome test
730,the variant could be a benign change that does not cause medical problems or it could be a disease causing abnormality
730,a why is the genetic test s being done the purpose of genetic testing is to look for changes in genes or gene products that cause a disease
730,this form can be used for both the patient who may benefit from the testing subject to the limitations discussed in this form and with your physician and family members who agree to be tested because their test results could help analyze the genetics of the patient
730,health provider statement by their signature below the healthcare provider indicates that he or she has explained the purpose of the test the procedures the benefits and risks that are involved in testing to their patient either the patient who may benefit from the test subject to its limitations or the family member of that patient who agreed to testing
730,what about confidentiality results will only be released to the ordering physician for the patient or designee and or others as entitled by law
730,if you are a family member the test is being ordered to help in analyzing the genetics of the patient
730,information regarding the reliability of positive or negative test results and the level of certainty that a positive test result for that disease or condition serves as a predictor of such disease
730,for example the interpretation of test results could be based upon probabilities and may not provide a 100 percent definitive answer to whether or not you have a specific genetic disease or are at risk for developing the disease
730,a discussion of the purpose and description of the test and a general written description of each specific disease or condition tested for 2 pre test counseling regarding the expected outcomes of testing the likelihood and type of incidental results that could be generated and what results will or will not be disclosed
730,3 even if the site specific genetic test identifies the variant s it is possible that it will not allow a prediction of the prognosis or severity of the disease lead to a change in disease management or provide a clinical benefit to patients
730,what do the test results mean the test results may indicate that you have a genetic disease or are at increased risk to be affected at a later age or at risk to have future affected children with this condition
730,the data may also reveal that you may be at risk for certain genetic diseases or if you are a carrier of disease associated mutations
730,as a result the laboratory conducting the neurome neurological exome test may not be able to analyze or report variants in patented genes even if they are relevant to the disorder in your family
