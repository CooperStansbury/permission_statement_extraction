[[fileID:434]],"the testing is being done because it may help determine whether  (patient) is affected with, or at risk to someday be affected with, a specific genetic disorder, subject to limitations discussed in this form."
[[fileID:434]],"if you are the patient s family member, the testing is being done because it might be helpful in evaluating the genetics of the patient."
[[fileID:434]],the method used for the targeted site-specific genetic test (which is called capillary sequencing ) has an analytical sensitivity of approximately 99% for the detection of small changes in genes (variants) and therefore provides a valid approach to test for specific variants previously identified through the neurome neurological exome test.
[[fileID:434]],"health provider statement by their signature below, the healthcare provider indicates that he or she has explained the purpose of the test, the procedures, the benefits and risks that are involved in testing to their patient (either the patient who may benefit from the test, subject to its limitations, or the family member of that patient who agreed to testing)."
[[fileID:434]],"what do the test results mean the test results may indicate that you have a genetic disease or are at increased risk to be affected at a later age, or at-risk to have future affected children with this condition."
[[fileID:434]],"also, there are some portions of the genome that the neurome neurological exome test may not capture and sequence sufficiently in your sample(s). note, the doctor ordering the test can request information about how well genes of interest were covered by the neurome neurological exome test."
[[fileID:434]],"also, even if the neurome neurological exome test identifies an underlying genetic cause of the disorder in a family, it is possible that it will not allow a prediction of the prognosis or severity of the disease, lead to a change in disease management or provide a clinical benefit to patients."
[[fileID:434]],"therefore, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries."
[[fileID:434]],their patient has been given the opportunity to ask questions about this consent and seek genetic counseling.
[[fileID:434]],this gives those people and companies the right to prevent others from using those patented genes for certain purposes.
[[fileID:434]],your refusal to have your specimen used for research purposes will not affect your results.
[[fileID:434]],it is important for you to understand that there is a possibility that the test results may not be able to determine whether you or a family member have a genetic disease or will develop one in the future.
[[fileID:434]],"however, there are technical and scientific reasons why, in rare cases, the result determined by this test could be inaccurate."
[[fileID:434]],"some of the information may be important to your present or future health, some of it may have nothing to do with your health and for much of it we will not know how it might or might not affect your or your family s health."

[[fileID:434]],"these changes may be due to a loss (deletion) gain (duplication), or substitution of genetic material."
[[fileID:434]],"also, the chance of an incorrect result, due to laboratory error incurred during any stage of the testing, cannot be completely excluded."
[[fileID:434]],"in some instances, this may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the athena diagnostics and/or others."
[[fileID:434]],"the neurome neurological exome test read this section if you are receiving the neurome neurological exome test what is different about a neurome neurological exome test a neurome neurological exome test differs from many other types of genetic tests because, instead of looking at only one or a few genes, the test looks at approximately 20,000 genes in the human genome to arrive at a potential genetic cause and diagnosis."
[[fileID:434]],parental testing may be recommended to find out if a parent also carries the genetic variant or to determine the variant s clinical significance.
[[fileID:434]],"this means that a genetic change (variant) was identified, but it is unknown whether the variant is the cause of medical problems in you."
[[fileID:434]],"any specimens that you have donated which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries."
[[fileID:434]],"as a result, the laboratory conducting the neurome neurological exome test may not be able to analyze or report variants in patented genes, even if they are relevant to the disorder in your family."

[[fileID:708]],we also use this section to reiterate that any additional tissue taken solely for banking during the clinical procedures would not significantly increase the risk to the participant (see collection of specimens).
[[fileID:708]],"thus, we recommend that investigators also seek permission to recontact the participant (see recontact below)."

[[fileID:128]],fixed prosthodontics treatment is composed of the following treatment modalities: (1) crowns: the fabrication of a crown (cap) or crowns to restore a tooth (teeth) as closely as possible to its original form and function.
[[fileID:128]],it may be necessary to refer the patient for treatment to an endodontist (root canal specialist) for the root canal procedure and/or referral to the periodontist (gum specialist) for periodontal surgical procedures.
[[fileID:128]],"therefore, a root canal is accomplished so that a post and core can be placed in the root canal space."

[[fileID:128]],"if this occurs, it will be necessary to start the procedure again by administering anesthesia, possibly reprepping the tooth, taking a new impression, and fabricating a new temporary."
[[fileID:128]],"in some cases, the fractured may have to be removed, but it is possible to save the remaining roots."
[[fileID:128]],it is made of acrylic and cemented with a sedative temporary cement.
[[fileID:128]],"if your temporary comes off and you leave it off, it is possible for the gum tissue to grow into the crown preparation and it is possible that the adjacent and opposing teeth will move thus preventing the permanent crown from fitting properly."
[[fileID:128]],(4) i understand that this is an elective procedure.
[[fileID:128]],"if the tooth requires a crown due to fracture of the remaining tooth structure or you are in need of a crown because the nerve has died and now you need a root canal, you will be credited the amount you paid for the inlay or onlay and then charged for the crown."
