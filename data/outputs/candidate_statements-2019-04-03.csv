[[fileID:605]],i have discussed the benefits and risks of this genetic test with my physician and/or other health care professional.
[[fileID:605]],predictive testing: a genetic test to determine if a person has one or more gene changes that increase the risk of developing a certain disease or condition at some time in the future.
[[fileID:605]],"where can i get more information about genetic testing and related services in michigan you can ask your physician, genetic counselor, or other health care provider."
[[fileID:605]],i have been informed that genetic testing can sometimes reveal secondary findings- results that are not related to the purpose of testing.

[[fileID:605]],: a negative or normal result means you do not have a change in the gene(s) tested.
[[fileID:605]],it is important that you discuss your genetic test results with your health care provider so that you are fully informed about what the results mean for you and your family.
[[fileID:605]],"also, speak to your health care professional about the possibility of secondary results and how they will be handled."
[[fileID:605]],i understand that this consent form is intended to be used together with the patient information booklet that contains important information explaining the above eight items.
[[fileID:605]],your health care provider should inform you about the condition(s) for which you are being offered testing as part of the genetic counseling that occurs before genetic testing.
[[fileID:605]],a genetic test can be done to: 	 2 confirm a diagnosis that is already suspected based on personal and family medical history and/or a medical exam.  	 
[[fileID:605]],/ amniotic fluid blood cheek swab chorionic villus sample (cvs) skin tissue block other the intended purpose is (check all that apply):
[[fileID:605]],genetic testing laboratories have different ways of reporting these types of secondary findings to patients and providers.
[[fileID:605]],n	 implications of results: the significance of a genetic change for your health/your family s health may not be known at the time of testing.
[[fileID:605]],"therefore, it is important for you to be willing to share your results with your family, especially if the condition you are being tested for is preventable."
[[fileID:605]],"when this type of testing is done, there is a possibility that it might reveal a risk for a genetic condition that is unrelated to the original reason for testing."
[[fileID:605]],"informed consent for genetic testing patient education information for use with the michigan model consent form for genetic testing many new advances are occurring in medicine, especially in the field of medical genetics."
[[fileID:605]],i received a copy of the form and booklet for my records.
[[fileID:605]],the booklet includes a glossary to help you understand genetics-related terms.
[[fileID:605]],"other unexpected findings, such as identifying a genetic risk unrelated to the condition for which testing was being performed."
[[fileID:605]],only you can decide if you want to be tested.
[[fileID:605]],this publication was supported in part by cooperative agreement 1u38gd000054-01 from the centers for disease control and prevention.
[[fileID:605]],"some tests look for genetic changes across a person s genetic makeup, rather than just looking at specific genes known to be related to the person s symptoms/ family history."
[[fileID:605]],sometimes your test results can provide your family members with important information about their genetic risks.
[[fileID:605]],"if you are being tested for a disease that runs in your family, but the test used is not for the condition your relative(s) actually had, your own result will not give accurate information about whether you have or are at risk for the condition."
[[fileID:605]],": a positive or abnormal test result means you carry a gene change that is known to cause a specific condition, or can put you at increased risk of developing a genetic condition."
[[fileID:605]],it is important for your health care provider to discuss how you want any potential secondary findings handled during your pre-test genetic counseling.
[[fileID:605]],neither may be altered nor deleted to change the meaning of specific statements above or the intent of the informed consent process.
[[fileID:605]],"the consent may allow you to say whether you are willing to have your sample used for other purposes, such as research."
[[fileID:605]],it was developed to help you and your health care provider discuss information that you should understand before consenting to a genetic test.
[[fileID:605]],a positive test result also indicates that you have an increased chance of having a child with the same genetic condition.
[[fileID:605]],this means a negative test does not always rule out the presence of every gene change that could cause a disease.
[[fileID:605]],laboratories may learn more about a variant in the future and this may allow the lab to eventually classify the variant as a normal (negative) or abnormal (positive) test result.
[[fileID:605]],"what do the results of genetic testing mean genetic tests are often a valuable tool, but sometimes do not provide a definite answer."
[[fileID:605]],"a genetic test is considered a predictive test if a result indicates a person has an increased chance of developing a disease or condition in the future, but developing the disease is not a certainty."
[[fileID:605]],"in most cases, being a carrier does not increase your chance of having any health concerns but there are some exceptions."
[[fileID:605]],"overall, before you proceed with genetic testing, make sure you understand what a negative, positive, or inconclusive test result will mean by discussing your situation with your physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or genetic counselor."
[[fileID:605]],"genetic tests are not always covered by medical insurance, and you may need to pay some or all of the cost. also consider whether you have a deductible for your health insurance and whether you have met the deductible for the year."
[[fileID:605]],a gene change that shows a healthy person will eventually develop a condition (presymptomatic testing) does not tell exactly when the condition will occur.
[[fileID:605]],"for this reason, if your testing reveals a variant, it is important to contact your health care provider periodically to see if any more information is available. "
[[fileID:605]],"sometimes the result for one family member can disclose information about the genetic makeup of other relatives, even if they have not been tested."
[[fileID:605]],"you still might have a change in a gene, even if your test is normal."
[[fileID:605]],presymptomatic testing: a genetic test performed before the onset of any symptoms to determine if a person has a gene change that will eventually cause a certain disease or condition.
[[fileID:605]],the health care provider who ordered the test will receive the results.
[[fileID:605]],"7.	 who has access to my sample and information from the test genetic tests are handled in a confidential manner, like other personal health information."
[[fileID:605]],it could also affect the ability to obtain or keep a job. 	 
[[fileID:605]],you should discuss with your health care provider ways that you can share your information with your family.
[[fileID:605]],"how they are reported depends on a number of factors including laboratory policies, whether knowing the result will change a person s medical care, and your preferences."
[[fileID:605]],what will happen to my sample after the genetic test is completed you have the right to know what will happen to any remaining sample.
[[fileID:605]],"genetic testing is highly accurate, but there are some limitations, including the following: n	 performing the correct test: your health care provider must have accurate information about your personal medical history and family history to determine which genetic test(s) to perform and correctly interpret the results."
[[fileID:605]],"3  	 a gene change that indicates an increased risk for developing a condition in the future (predictive testing) cannot predict with certainty whether a person will actually develop the condition, or when symptoms will appear. 	 "
[[fileID:605]],your health care provider will explain the purpose of the test and try to answer your questions.
[[fileID:605]],"if you still have unanswered questions, be sure to ask your physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or genetic counselor before you agree to have the genetic test being offered to you."
[[fileID:605]],your health care provider is responsible for ensuring that the consent form that you sign complies with michigan law.
[[fileID:605]],this booklet was prepared by the michigan department of health and human services in compliance with michigan law to help answer your questions about genetic testing.
[[fileID:605]],"in such cases, a genetic change, called a variant (sometimes referred to as variants of uncertain significance ), may be identified but the laboratory does not have enough information to determine whether or not the change is associated with a genetic condition/risk."
[[fileID:605]],"i understand some genetic tests can involve possible medical, psychological or insurance issues for my family and me."
[[fileID:605]],find out if you will be responsible for any or all of the test bill.
[[fileID:605]],"if a genetic test is performed, your insurance company may have access to the result. 	 "

[[fileID:605]],knowing about a certain gene might provide important health information for a person s family.
[[fileID:605]],people often have questions about the condition for which testing is being considered.
[[fileID:605]],i have discussed with my health care professional if and/or how such results will be shared with me.
[[fileID:605]],"however, there can be limits to the information provided when a gene change is found, such as: 	 a gene change that confirms a suspected diagnosis (diagnostic testing) may not give information about how severe the condition will be."
[[fileID:605]],"if you have children or are considering having children, it is important to talk to your health care provider about what your test results mean for them."
[[fileID:605]],your written permission is required before your medical record is released to anyone else.
[[fileID:605]],"if your test result is negative, you may want to ask whether a better test is likely to become available and then check back with your health care provider periodically in the future."
[[fileID:605]],"informed consent: a person s agreement to allow a medical test, treatment or procedure based on a full understanding of all the facts necessary to weigh the benefits and risks."
[[fileID:605]],the booklet also includes a model consent form that contains the minimum information an individual undergoing a genetic test must understand as required by michigan law.
[[fileID:605]],carrier status: the knowledge of whether a healthy person has a disease-causing gene change (mutation) that could be passed down to his or her children.
[[fileID:605]],"as part of the informed consent, your health care provider should discuss this with you before genetic testing."
[[fileID:605]],"12 www.michigan.gov/mdhhs mdhhs is an equal opportunity employer, services, and programs provider."
[[fileID:605]],"having knowledge can empower a person and family members to make important life planning decisions, even if a cure is not available at that time. 	 "
[[fileID:605]],"the process involves: assessing a person s chance of a genetic condition based on family history, medical history information and genetic test results; providing education about the genetic condition(s) for which they are at risk and what it could mean to the family; helping the patient and family make informed choices about the use of genetic information based on the family s values and beliefs; and helping the family adapt to living with the condition or risk for the condition."
[[fileID:605]],i have read both this consent form and the booklet.
[[fileID:605]],our goal is to make sure you are well informed before you decide to give a sample for testing.
[[fileID:605]],n	 secondary findings: sometimes genetic testing reveals a finding that is unrelated to the reason for doing the test.

[[fileID:538]],"i understand that if my teeth have these conditions, i should have my cavities filled or my fillings redone before undergoing the whitening treatment."
[[fileID:538]],this is due to inadvertent exposure of a small area of those tissues to the whitening gel or the ultraviolet light.

[[fileID:538]],"during the entire treatment, a plastic retractor will be placed in my mouth to help keep it open and the soft tissues of my mouth (i.e., my lips, gums, cheeks and tongue) will be covered to ensure they are not exposed to either the gel or light."
